## Description
Wondering how hard your next class might be? Did other students think CS162 was a bloodbath, too? This app can tell you!

The OSU eCampus subreddit collects course reviews from real students into this spreadsheet, but the spreadsheet is large and hard to navigate. This app lets you view individual course reviews and aggregates difficulty ratings and time spent.

This project was developed with the flutter both for Android and iOS.

The below links are for the web version of the application.

## Author
This project was created by Naohito Muraoka by using Flutter. I am looking for other developer to work both for improving this projects and for working with web versions of university course search projects using Ruby on Rails.
